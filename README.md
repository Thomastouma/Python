# ThomasAndKristianProgram
Thomas and Kristians python program.

Our program allows the user to create an account at TK gym AB, buy a gym membership, order a workout plan and also allows the user to
calcute their own BMI(Body Mass Index) by inputing the required details(height, weight, age) for doing so.
At first we had a big trouble getting our program to save the user creation credentials down into a .txt file and read those credentials from the .txt file for a comparement to the user inputted details during the login phase in our program. But goal oriented and focused as we both are, we managed to solve this problem trough continous trial and error.
